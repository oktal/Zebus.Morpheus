# Zebus.Morpheus

Morpheus is a simple, but yet very handy utility to help assess [Zebus](https://github.com/Abc-Arbitrage/Zebus)
implementations

# Simulation

At the heart of Morpheus is a simulation. A simulation is a test scenario that Morpheus will run to validate
the behavior of one or multiple peers

A simulation will send commands or events to one or multiple peers and will expect responses, commands or events
being sent back

# Example

``` 
ðŸš€ [echo]                       OK
ðŸš€ [basic-command]              OK
ðŸš€ [routed-command]             OK
ðŸš€ [basic-event]                OK
```
